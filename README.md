# Anavaro Theme

This base Anavaro theme. I have writen it for my own blog. Feel free to use it, extend it and have fun with it. I will provide as much support as I can and will fix issues as you (or I find them).

You can use this theme free of charge.

## Features

Bootstrap mobile first

Index page with carousel, 3 column feature and last 5 posts

Suports full width pages as well as pages with sidebar

3 sidebars to the bottom

Custom user info page with support of info, pucture, projects and job history (think of it as CV page) and with top level redirection (domain.tld/short-url-you-want);

Using font awsome for most of the images (get lower bandwith).

Admin page allowing to add Google Analytics, Facebook API, Twitter API, Google+ ... A lot of ``<head>`` stuff.

## Specifics:
You will need to create a page with Blog template and configure it in theme customization.


## To DO:

Fix the lame ass selector on 3 featured template

I sure need to optimize some script loading.

I need to lower the db requests (WordPress is not so optimized ...)
## Install
```git clone https://github.com/satanasov/anavarotheme.git anavaro```

Activate from admin panel.

Configure from Anvaro settings.

## Support
You could open issues and PRs in the github repo and I will open a new subforum in my laboratory forum for other issues.
